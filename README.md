### Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. The Python script employs various data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing techniques to analyze a credit card fraud dataset. Three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) are initially trained and evaluated. Class imbalance issues are then addressed through both oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling techniques, and the models are retrained on the balanced datasets. The performance of each model is thoroughly assessed using classification reports, F1 scores, and confusion matrices. Results are visualized through heat maps and count plots. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of credit card fraud detection methods and their effectiveness.
### Twitter Bot Detection
This Python script uses three different graph-based models (GCN, GAT, and RGCN) for binary classification to detect bots in the Twibot 22 dataset. The data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and normalized using min-max scaling. The script then builds and trains each model, evaluates its performance on the testing set, and prints accuracy and F1 scores for each model. The overall scores for GCN, GAT, and RGCN are also displayed.

### Sudoku Game Solution using Hill Climbing Algorithm
This Python code implements a Sudoku solver using a hill-climbing algorithm. The Sudoku class initializes a random puzzle and employs a hill-climbing approach to optimize the puzzle's arrangement. The fixed values are predefined, and the algorithm iteratively swaps values to improve the puzzle's fitness score. The fitness function evaluates the uniqueness of values in rows, columns, and quadrants.

The main loop runs the hill climbing algorithm for multiple trials, displaying the progress and identifying the best-performing puzzle. The final result is presented along with a plot showing the fitness scores over iterations, demonstrating the solver's progress.

### Linear Regression on Housing Data
This project predicts housing prices through various regression techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis, shuffling, encoding categorical features, and standardization. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions are applied, alongside Lasso and Ridge regressions with hyperparameter tuning. The project explores regularization's impact on feature coefficients and concludes with insights into model accuracy and robustness.

### LDA and QDA on S&P Stock Market Data
This project applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to S&P stock market data. Balanced prior probabilities indicate even class distribution in training data. Group means analysis identifies associations between market directions and preceding days' returns. LDA predicts trends based on group coefficients, showing slightly better performance than QDA. Further analysis is needed to comprehensively understand their strengths and limitations in predicting stock market trends. The overall accuracy of both models remains moderate.

### Decision Tree on Bill Authentication Data
This project employs Decision Tree Classification on the bill_authentication dataset. It begins by loading and preprocessing the data, including feature selection and standardization. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and a Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the former. With a remarkable accuracy of 0.99, the model excels in distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit bills. The confusion matrix provides a detailed performance breakdown, showcasing strong true positive results while revealing areas for potential enhancement. The project underscores the efficacy of Decision Tree Classification for bill authenticity assessment.

### SVM on Credit Card Dataset
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Achieving an AUC of 0.84, the SVM model demonstrates robust performance, excelling in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### K-Means on Live Dataset
This project applies K-means clustering to the "live.csv" dataset. Initial analysis suggests 2 clusters, but further examination reveals suboptimal fit. Revisiting with k=4 yields improved accuracy (0.62), indicating a more accurate representation of underlying patterns. Hence, 4 clusters are recommended for this dataset.

### Sales project
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data for phones and gadgets using Python. The project involves importing necessary packages, collecting and creating a dataset from multiple CSV files containing sales data, cleaning the data, and then performing various analyses to gain insights.

### Bike Sales Analysis
Cleaned bike sales data, built pivot tables revealing income, commute, & age group impact on sales. Created an interactive dashboard with slicers, sparking deeper customer purchase insights.

### Coffee Sales Analysis
Cleaned bike sales data, built pivot tables revealing sales over time, sales per country, & top 5 customers. Created an interactive dashboard with slicers, & differents charts.
